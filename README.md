# Calculation logic
Raoult's law states that partial pressure of a voc = mole fraction * vapor pressure / total pressure as they are proportional. Once the voc partial pressure is obtained we can plug the pressure of the voc into the ideal gas law to obtain the amount of voc in the air

# Units
## Units used in voc_parameters.json
- Density: g/L
- Volume: L
- Molecular Weight: g/mol
Vapor pressure can be calculated with antoine equation with the following calculator:
